FULL OUTER JOIN ----> Simetric JOIN, it grabs all information and match it

LEFT OUTER JOIN ----> Non simetric JOIN
Entries UNIQUE to Table A: Found in Table A and not found in Table B

SELECT * FROM TableA
LEFT OUTER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.col_match = TableB.col_match
WHERE TableB.id IS null

Query to show films that are not in inventory
SELECT
	film.film_id,
	film.title,
	inventory_id,
	store_id
FROM film
LEFT JOIN inventory ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
WHERE
	inventory.film_id IS null


RIGHT JOIN
Essentialy is the same as LEFT JOIN, except the tables are switched.
It would be the same as changing order in a LEFT JOIN
