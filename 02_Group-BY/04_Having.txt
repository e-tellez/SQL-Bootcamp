Allows to filter after an aggregation has already taken place

Examples:

Notes: SUM function happens after GROUP BY
SELECT
	customer_id,
	SUM(amount) as tpv
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 100

SELECT
	store_id,
	COUNT(customer_id)
FROM customer
GROUP BY store_id
HAVING COUNT(customer_id) > 300
